Easypost Javascipt API for Parse BaaS specifically

If you are using Easypost integration with Parse.com BaaS, you can use this library in your code.
Here is how you do it.

1. Copy this file to your cloud/ folder in Parse cloud code.
2. Initialize the JS with var EasyPostAPI = require('cloud/easypostapi.js')('Your API KEY');
3. That's it. Code happily.

You can use Backbone style response methods, or promises as well.
If you see any errors please report it to me and I will try to resolve those or assign you as a contributor.
